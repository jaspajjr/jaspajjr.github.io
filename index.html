					<h2>Joe</h2>
					<p>John Carney has always gone above and beyond for me. He is always passionately learning, and as a by-product always passionately teaching. He takes initiative to talk to aspects of the business that rarely approach him and offers his guidance to all aspects of the business, treating Data Science as a universal tool.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Leading an initiative to overhaul the search ranking function. The order of the hotel results presented to customer has a huge impact on overall revenue generation. I led a cross-departmental team to build a new ranking system, to allow increased personalisation, new revenue channels, and optimisation of existing KPIs. This involved the development of a proprietary algorithm, data pipelines, and deployment system, using pair programming, test driven-development, version control (git) and microservices architecture.</li>
						<li>Development of a fraud detection system. Working with Finance and Customer Relation teams to identify the scale of the problem, I led a team that worked which incorporated the Site Reliability Engineering team to develop and deliver and real-time fraud detection algorithm.</li>
						<li>To maximise the Data Science's potential at LateRooms, I worked closely with the Infrastructure and Site Reliability teams to adapt existing architecture to more easily capture, and act upon data being collected. By leveraging Kafka, and Google Big Query, we were able to utilise data sources and applications which were previously inaccessible, allowing us to build customer focused products such as an in journey customer segmentation engineer. </li>
						<li>Conceived and led a project to aid the Finance and the Analytics teams to understand the requirements and use cases for demand forecasting, before developing and deploying an automated demand forecasting system, that created reports for business and financial analysts.</li>
